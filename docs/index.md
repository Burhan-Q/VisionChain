##Â Vision Chain 

Constraining artificial stupidity. 

It's often surprisingly difficult to train out a stubborn false positive. These false positives can appear very stupid to clients. It can be a simple thing like an object of a given colour is NEVER some class, or that an object of a given size is NEVER another. These problems are simple and these mistakes should not be made. 

Good tooling to suggest sensible heuristics, to correct for these false positives does not exist, and this is one problem (among many others), that VisionChain aims to solve.
