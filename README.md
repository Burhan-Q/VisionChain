# VisionChain
Framework to support common preprocessing and postprocessing steps, along with computer vision heuristics built with opencv, and voting systems ontop of those heuristic-model combos. 

Could add a hyperparameter optimizer for things like setting the confidence at which to intervene.

Constraining artificial stupidity and giving AI some hand rails.

To Do: 
- [ ] Create some templates, e.g. cascade model
- [ ] Support VQA models on crops or similar
- [ ] Support NN Classifiers based on the embeddings of multiple models.
- [ ] Support Segmentation models
- [ ] Support more from https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything/tree/main
