# VisionChain
Framework to support common preprocessing and postprocessing steps, along with computer vision heuristics built with opencv, and voting systems ontop of those heuristic-model combos. 

Could add a hyperparameter optimizer for things like setting the confidence at which to intervene.

Constraining artificial stupidity and giving AI some hand rails.
