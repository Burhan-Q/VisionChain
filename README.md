Framework to support common preprocessing and postprocessing steps, along with computer vision heuristics built with opencv, and voting systems ontop of those heuristic-model combos. 

## Tools it would lean on: 

* sklearn.ensemble
* supervision
* dataclasses
* jupyter-scatter ? 
* pandas 
* CocoFrame (pending completion)
